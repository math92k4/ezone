# ezone

https://nifty-perlman-00a8fe.netlify.app/

The result of a 3 day sprint, prototyping a form for the company Ezone with focus on UX and logic.

Created with SASS and JS modules. Bundled with Vite.js. 
The data is read from, and posted to database using REST.
Database is the free version of restdb.io - thats why it's so slooooow :))
